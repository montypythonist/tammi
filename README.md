# TAMMI: True Adaptive Modeling Multiemotional Intelligence
## (Webcam version)
True Adaptive Modeling Multiemotional Intelligence, or "TAMMI" for short, is an EI, emotional intelligence, that helps users correctly identify the emotions of others and interpret social cues more accurately. This project is targeted towards those who are neurodivergent, have some form of alexithymia, or general blindness towards social/emotional cues, however it is not restricted only to people with those conditions.

## Changes Made:

### Nov 16, 2025:
- JSON feature selection for easier customization of features and reduce lag of processes that the user does not want to run
- adjusted emotion bias/weights for better detection


### Sep 8, 2025:
- initial commit of doom (the pre-alpha version of TAMMI)


## Features of TAMMI:
- (TammiLens, not out yet) camera glasses that scan facial/auditory social cues and emotions
- informs the user with accurate mood detections to increase social awareness
- makes you a better socializer!
